# Self-Evaluation
## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- So far I feel fairly confident with Arrays and would like to take more time to look further through the article on Ruby Docs
## Is there any additional learning you neeed or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- As mentioned, I'll be looking over the Ruby Docs article more in-depth to learn more. I've also bookmarked the article so that I can continue my learning.
## What questions do you have about *arrays*?
- I'm interested to understand what this looks like on a large scal when there is a lot of data to sift through. I would also like to play around with arrays and conditionals to see how much we could do with extra data in the variables.
